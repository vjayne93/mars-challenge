# mars-challenge
The purpose of this challenge is to use web scraping tools to analyze data about the planet Mars. 
The first portion of the challenge examines headlines and previews of news articles with updates on activities taking place on Mars.
The second potion of the challenge analyzes days and weather patterns on Mars.
I utilized the XPert Learning Assistant in the completion of this challenge.
